	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<ul>
	    <li><p>In this Project, the design, development, and results are proposed for a new Advanced Multipurpose Hand Hygiene Dispensary system using IOT.
	    The system is designed to minimise the use of Hand Touch operated Dispensers in Hospitals, Malls and public places in order to reduce the spread of virus as well as to track hand washing activities with Temperature Monitoring, Measuring liquid level and update it to cloud. The proposed architecture of the Dispensary system is designed based on the parallel working of sensors in order to Increase the speed and accuracy of taking multiple Inputs and provide output to the user. The system uses Ultrasonic sensor which measures distance of object. The entire system works when the User gets in contact with the range of Ultrasonic sensor.</p></li> 
		<li>The Dispensary system is equipped with MLX90614 Temperature sensor which takes Hand Temperature Readings of user and displays it to user in LCD Display while dispensing the liquid. Existing Dispensers are not Integrated with technology for measuring the Liquid level in the body for refilling it. So, In this paper an Ultrasonic sensor is placed on the bottom of lid in the body which measures the Liquid level Distance and displays it in the IOT Cloud Platform.
        The performance and Experimental result is compared with existing dispensers in the market. From comparison, it is observed that use of IOT technology increased automating of multiple purposes of things which helped to reduced the spread of virus, visualizing, analizing of live data in real time, and also increased efficiency and cost effective operation.</li>
    </ul>
	<h1>Features</h1>
	<ul>
			<li> Temperature sensor Integration</li>
			<li>level of Liquid Content from the nodes will be displayed in DashBoard.</li>
			<li>Displaying location access of nodes where it is deployed</li>
